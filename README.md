Weather Dashboard Project

## Description

- What was your motivation?

    My motivation for tackling the project was to learn how to dynamically updated HTML and CSS using JavaScript code.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

    I built the project to further develop my javascript skills using querySelectors, setInterval and clearInterval functions and localStorage. 

- What problem does it solve?

    Learning about querySelectors, setInterval functions and localStorage helps with selecting specific elements faster, creating timers, and storing information locally.

- What did you learn?

    I learned different types of functions and querySelectors along different type of information storage to improve my javascript learning.
